# homelab

This is a summary of my homelab. I want to self-host some of my own services or applications online. Like, My NAS services, JupyterLab, Personal Blog, Gitlab, Pihole, OpenWrt etc. 

## Dashboard

I make a home page using a github project named homer, https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer. This dashboard is easy to deploy through a docker image.



All services are listed bellow:

|        Application        |  Hosted-server   |                  URL                   |
